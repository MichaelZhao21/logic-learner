# logic-learner
Project for CalHacks 2021!

If you would like to build this project on your own, feel free to open the solution in visual studio and run the LogicLearner project! 
If you need to calibrate your camera settings, adjust the properties of `WireformSketchProperties` found in MainWindow.xaml.cs.
To visually calibrate the software, simply execute the WireFormSketch demo project included within this project.

Note: The WireForm and WireFormSketch source code provided in this example is *not* our hackathon submission. The hackathon project is the educational tool *Logic Learner* built on top of these libraries.
